        another function which will set background color of body as per button click.  */

        document.getElementById('green').onclick = clickHandler('green')
        
        // in above code return fun() ahving access of color otherwise it don't execute. bcz while returning the fun()
        // it returns whole lexical scope(means child fun have access of parent fun) of fun() that's why it's working.

        /*=========================================== Notes ==================================================
        Lexical scope - 

        Lexical scope refers to how the variable scope is defined in the source code. In JavaScript, the scope of a variable is determined by 
        its location within the code (the placement in the source code). When you declare a variable or a function inside another function, 
        the inner function has access to the variables declared in its outer (enclosing) function. This access to variables is based on 
        their lexical environment, which means it looks at the code where the functions are defined.

        Closure - 

        A closure is created when a function retains access to its lexical scope (the scope in which it was defined) even after the outer function
        has finished execution. This means that the inner function "remembers" and has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function
        even after the outer function has completed.
Example - 
        Imagine you have a recipe book, and in that book, there's a recipe (function) for making a cake. Inside that recipe, 
        you mention using sugar from the kitchen (variable). Even if you take the recipe to another kitchen (another place in the code) 
        where it doesn't know about that sugar, it will still remember and use the sugar mentioned in its own instructions—that's like a closure! 
        The recipe holds on to its needed ingredients no matter where you take it.

        So, closures are like a function's memory—keeping hold of things it needs even after it should theoretically forget about them based on 
        where it's located in the code.
