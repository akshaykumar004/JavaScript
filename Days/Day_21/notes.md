## why use OOP
Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript offers a structured and organized way to build complex applications by representing real-world entities as objects
JavaScript, being a versatile language, supports both OOP and other programming paradigms. OOP principles provide a structured way to manage code complexity, enhance reusability, and build scalable applications.

## Parts of OOP
Object literal 
Constructor function
Prototypes
Classes
Instances (new, this)

## OOPs properties  - 
# Abstraction: 
Objects in OOP encapsulate data and behavior, hiding the complex implementation details. This abstraction allows developers to focus on using objects without needing to know their internal workings, enhancing code readability and reducing complexity.

# Encapsulation: 
OOP allows bundling data (properties) and functions (methods) that operate on the data within a single unit (object). This helps in data protection and prevents unintended interference or modification of data, providing more control over the program.

# Inheritance: 
JavaScript supports inheritance through prototype chaining or ES6 classes. Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, promoting code reuse and facilitating a hierarchical structure among objects.

# Polymorphism: 
OOP in JavaScript enables polymorphism, where objects can share the same interface while implementing unique behavior. This allows for flexibility and extensibility in designing software.
